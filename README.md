HUD for Warp System

This project has several elements:

  A 'radar' which is actually a sine wave generator, I am using multiple waves each offset by a 
  small margin to create an overlapping "barometer" feel to it.
  
  Ship Stats which displays Shield Strength, Hull Integrity etc
  
  A way to increase and decrease your ships speed.
  
  These are all buttons which are interactable on the screen, the 'speed' variable
  affects the output of each of these elements. Higher speeds decreases the Shield
  Strength, it also causes the scanner to become more erratic.
  
  As you increase your speed past Warp 9, you will get warnings telling you to reduce 
  your speed, this is akin to the Transwarp Barrier in Star Trek. 
  
  If you ignore the warnings and continue to accelerate, you will eventually exceed
  the transwarp threshold, achieving infinite velocity, which has the downside of 
  liquefying the crew. Dang.
